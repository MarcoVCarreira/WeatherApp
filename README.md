This is a Weather App for a Website using HTML CSS and JavaScript. We will get the current weather data from the Fess API key from OpenWeatherMap and display the weather information like Temperature, Weather condition, Humidity and Wind Speed according to the city on our website or app.
We will display the weather info on website from Free API using JavaScript.
In this weather app I have added one search box where the user can enter the city name and get the weather information of the city.


Please have a look at the App here is the link - https://marcovcarreira.github.io/WeatherApp/
